# CSCI4120Assignment2

This is a Tank game with enemy AIs. AIs are built using PluggableAI with Scriptable Objects, based on a FSM 
(Finite State Machine). 

Scripts controlling AI behavior are in CSCI4120Assignment2/Assets/PluggableAI/Scripts.

There are three types of AI tanks: chaser(that keeps chasing the player until one of them is killed), patroller(that patrols in a certain area until player is seen), and a wanderer(that only wanders in the terrain until player is seen).

The environment and game assets are imported from the Unity Tank Tutorial.
